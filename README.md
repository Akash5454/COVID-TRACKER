## Description
- COVID-19 is an infectious disease which spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread     when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

- If the droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or           surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.

- It has an incubation period ranging from 1-14  days.
- So if a person is COVID postive then it is important to track all the people and places he visited last 14 days and quarantine them.

- For the authorities, it is very difficult to track the people and places that a COVID postive person visited.

- This is where our Web-Application come in handy. If a person shows any symptoms or suspects that he might be COVID positive, he can     register on this website and alert his/her real time location from time to time.
